- 👋 Hi, I’m @EdwardGHPh. I'm a MSc Physics student at uOttawa.
- 👀 I’m interested in physics and computer science, particularly the intersection between the two. There are some interesting ML and StatMechs out there... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning and how to use it in physics applications.
