- 👋 Hi, I’m @EdwardGHPh
- 👀 I’m interested in physics and computer science, particularly the intersection between the two. There are some interesting ML and StatMechs out there... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning and how to use it in physics applications. At some point I want to work on some quantum machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything interesting.
- 📫 Reach me through my work email edward.ghphy@gmail.com
